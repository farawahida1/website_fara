<h2> FARA'S EXPERIENCE </h2>

<center><img src="images/athlete.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 450px;"></center>
<center><h3 style="font-size: 20px;">MSSD Athletics Tournament 2019</h3></center>

<p style="margin-right: 80px; margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;">In 2019, I was chosen to represent my school in the MSSD event, which we hosted that year. I also represented the school in the P18 javelin event. With a throw distance of 28 meters, I finished third in this event.This record also makes me the new school level throwing record holder. In addition, I competed in the stone spare event and finished second with a throw distance of 30 meters. But I had to abandon my desire of competing in the future competition since my studies are as important, and I will be taking the SPM examination that year.The teachers advised me to stop from participating in the next sports events because I am also a target student for SPM 2019. It was heartbreaking, but I had no choice but to accept it. In the end, I only became a coach for students who had recently joined school athletics.</p>

<center><h3 style="font-size: 20px;">PART TIME: KINDERGARTEN TEACHER</h3></center>

<p style="margin-right: 80px; margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;">After graduating from high school, I was hired as a three-month replacement kindergarten teacher. This experience is really valuable to me since it will teach me how to speak with kids. This is due to the fact that I am constantly awkward with kids. This job also allows me to obtain financial resources to help me continue my studies.</p>

<center><h3 style="font-size: 20px;">PART TIME: ARTIST</h3></center>

<p style="margin-right: 80px; margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;">I have taken a drawing payment in exchange for an art subject teaching session for SPM 2020, where I will teach how to draw, color, sketch, and anything else relating to the SPM art education subject's specific work. In addition, I will charge a fee to do sketches for visual arts students who want assistance with sketching. The images above are of some of my paintings that I have sold at the request of people who are interested in my work. But now that I am increasingly exposed to computers and studying, I am drawing less and creating artwork, and the artistic talent that I inherited from my family is slowly fading. </p>
