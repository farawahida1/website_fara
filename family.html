<h2> MY BELOVED FAMILY <3 </h2>

<img src="images/mom.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 450px;">

<h4>MY ONE AND ONLY MOM</h4>

<p style="margin-right: 80px; margin-left: 80px;text-align: justify;"> HOLLA! this is my beloved mom. Her name is <strong>NORISAH BINTI HAMZAH 45 years old.</strong> My mother is a housewife, and she is now obsessed with planting flowers in the back yard HAHAHA. I can't express how much I adore her. Someone who encouraged me and became a friend to whom I could communicate my thoughts when I was sad or happy. My mum is also my best buddy. I shall remember the affection that was shown to me till the day I die. My mother never harmed us or even pinched us when she was upset. My mother was so burdened by life that I couldn't bear to see her.I am dedicated to offer my mother success in whatever career I choose, regardless of the challenges that may arise. MAAA, I love you.</p>

<img src="images/momdad.jpg" style="height: 400px; width: 450px;">

<h4> BEST DAD EVER </h4>

<p style="margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px;text-align: justify;">This is my dad but i call him as "ABAH" <strong>Zulkpli Bin Muhd Yusoff, age 54</strong>, is his name. Yes, that's how his name is spelled. HAHAHA, let's blame it on my grandfather. Okay, let me tell you a little bit about my Abah. When treating somebody, he is very gentle. Someone who is really strong and works incredibly hard to protect our family. People who don't understand the distinction of exhausted and tired. My father would drive the family to work in the morning and then to our goat field in the evening. My father will take care of our 40 goats. At noon, I'll also help feed the goats. I can't imagine my life without this person, a person who supports me a lot even in silence. The love given to us siblings is very deep and his love story with my mother is one of the most romantic stories for me. I hope that when I meet my life partner, he is exactly like my father. Thank You Abah For Everything. I LOVE YOU 3000 </p>

JUST A LITTLE AND NOT MORE. She had her own mini market at Jerteh, Terengganu. She is someone's fiancee, and she is getting married next year.</td>

      <td><h3>ADIK</h3> This is my younger brother, named <strong>MUHAMMAD HARRAZ RIZQI BIN ZULKPLI</strong>. My younger brother died when he was four months old in 2021. He passed away as a result due brain bleeding, and the doctor told us that even if my brothe survived, she would be paralyzed all over. Our family's life was terrible at the time, and my parents had to go back and forth from Pasir Puteh to USM Hospital Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, whenever the doctor called. Because of the presence of the PKK in Malaysia at the time, the other siblings were not allowed to leave. We only saw our brothe after he passed away. When it is revealed that he has been safely born into this world, his very presence is enough to make us happy. Thank you for the lovely memories.</td>
